## üëã Hi there!
I'm Bernardo, an aeronautical engineer with a BSc in Aeronautical Engineering and (hopefully soon) an MSc in Data Science. My passion lies in both coding and engineering. I'm from Zurich üá®üá≠ and have over seven years of experience working as an aeronautical engineer and around two years as a data scientist.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Experience  
During my time at Bucher Leichtbau AG, I provided advice and support to all departments regarding initial airworthiness certification. My expertise included interpreting certification specifications, verifying documentation for "minor" and "major changes," and communicating with customers, official bodies, and authorities. Additionally, I provided consulting services to the development department for design optimization.

In 2021, I transitioned to data science and joined Crealogix AG. There, I provided advice and support to the department on new data science and machine learning products. My responsibilities included creating prospect and upsell models, extracting information from fact-sheets using customized OCR, and developing user journeys for chatbot dialogue flow. I also developed chatbot solutions using IBM Watson and Spacy.

After my time at Crealogix, I joined Prognolite AG, where I developed regression models to predict turnover and menu sales using customer data and external data such as weather or public holidays. We utilized Multi-Output Regression, Quartoüëç, R, and Python, and implemented customized API calls to fetch the data from the database. It was really cool stuff ‚ö°.

Currently, I am in the final stages of my Master's programm üôà, and soon I will be starting a new adventure... (to be continued üòé).
